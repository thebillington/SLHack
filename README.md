Scott Logic Hackathon
=======================

At Scott Logic we run Hackathon events for students at various universities across the country, including Bristol, Durham and Newcastle. You can find out about the future events from our website (http://www.scottlogic.com/about/events/).

The code in this repository is the 'starter' project for the hack, where students are asked to create an algorithm that makes automated trades against a dummy trading platform. The winner is the student who makes the most money!

Competing students need to:
* Download source as a zip and extract.
* Open [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1) and right-click the Package Explorer
* Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
* Browse to unzipped project, select Hackathon. Click Finish.
* Right click Hackathon/src/(default package)/TestImplementation -> Run As -> Java Application.
* Fill in the Hackathon/src/trading/TradingStrategy to do trading
